            <p>There is a paid license available which unlocks advanced features that will save even
              more time writing and maintaining scores for a drum corps. More details about this are

            <p>There's a whole bunch of legal stuff as per the license above, but really this is
              just to say it's free and no-one is allowed to sell you it, nor can you sell it on.
              You can't use it to make money either unless we agree that in advance as you'll
              probably want better support than the best efforts there is with this, given it's free!

            <h3>Studio Edition Features</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Rudiment Libraries - often used phrases and rudiments can be dragged and dropped
                onto any number of libraries, which can be organised as you like, e.g. a 2/4 library,
                a strathspey phrase library</li>
              <li>Bar content guidance, warns you if there too few or too many notes in a bar</li>
              <li>Automatic joining of tails of notes (beaming), includes ensuring only a single
                line used on primary subdivisions within a beat</li>
              <li>Export as JPEG, PDF, PNG or SVG file for onwards uses as graphic images, e.g. embed
                in a document</li>
              <li>Clone whole staff line - it’s a workflow that automates copying a staff line and
                it’s contents and inserts it. All possible without the workflow, but just more keystrokes</li>
              <li>1st and 2nd time workflow - these will take the last line of a part and duplicate
                it and sort out the unison and bar markers and add some text to show which line is
                which time. Note that for single bars or groups of notes you want to mark as 1st and 2nd time
                it doesn’t do anything clever yet - in some ways it clutters a score doing that and with software
                it’s easy enough to add whole new lines and or parts - seen many scores where folks
                have tried to mark up changes and only 2 bars in the part were the same! Far better to
                use no repeats in that case imho</li>
              <li>New score preferences are saved between launches of the software so if you always
                want your new scores generated with pink highlight for unison, this will remember</li>
              <li>Workspace preferences are saved, window size etc</li>
              <li>Block selection - without this you can select runs of notes, but if you wanted to
                say select bars 3 and 4 and 7 and 8 of a 2/4 which has 4 bars per line because you
                want to copy and paste the middles and endings, this is your friend</li>
              <li>Vertically align notes - you can do this by hand without this tool, but this is
                so much easier</li>
              <li>Squeeze / expand runs of notes - you’ve entered your masterful selection of singles
                and decided you need more space on the page or indeed that you have space to spread
                them out more - this will proportionately allow you to spread them out or push them
                closer together</li>
              <li>Beautify your score - very experimental, in it’s first rendition but can produce
                some good results, you basically ask it to go place the notes where they “should be”
                in each bar. Sometimes the logical placing isn’t pretty, e.g. dot and cut, so some
                opinions have been embedded in the code! You could spend a lifetime tweaking this or
                even write a thesis on it</li>
